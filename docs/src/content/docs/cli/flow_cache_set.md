title: Flow Cache Set

## flow cache set

Set cached data by key.

### Synopsis

The data store is a key-value store that can be used to persist data across executions. Values that are set outside of an executable will persist across all executions until they are cleared. When set within an executable, the data will only persist across serial or parallel sub-executables but all values will be cleared when the parent executable completes.

This will overwrite any existing value for the key.

```
