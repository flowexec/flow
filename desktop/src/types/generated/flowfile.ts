   * Keywords that describe the action an executable performs. Executables are configured with a single verb,

   *
   * ### Default Verb Aliases
   *
   * - **Execution Group**: `exec`, `run`, `execute`
   * - **Retrieval Group**: `get`, `fetch`, `retrieve`
   * - **Display Group**: `show`, `view`, `list`
   * - **Configuration Group**: `configure`, `setup`
   * - **Update Group**: `update`, `upgrade`
   *
   * ### Usage Notes
   *
   * 1. [Verb + Name] must be unique within the namespace of the workspace.
   * 2. When referencing an executable, users can use any verb from the default or configured alias group.
   * 3. All other verbs are standalone and self-descriptive.
   *
   * ### Examples
   *
   * - An executable configured with the `exec` verb can also be referenced using "run" or "execute".
   * - An executable configured with `get` can also be called with "list", "show", or "view".
   * - Operations like `backup`, `migrate`, `flush` are standalone verbs without aliases.
   * - Use domain-specific verbs like `deploy`, `scale`, `tunnel` for clear operational intent.
   *
   * By providing minimal aliasing with comprehensive verb coverage, flow enables natural language operations
   * while maintaining simplicity and flexibility for diverse development and operations workflows.
